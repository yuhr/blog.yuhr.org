{"pageProps":{"issue":{"body":"Every time I hear people saying “hard” or “soft” when talking about indentation style, I feel it's the other way around, because what people call the “soft” way is to bake the visual width of indentation into the file, which can be thought as a typical instance of hardcoding, like in analogy with “hard wraps”.\r\n\r\nActually, they're saying “hard” or “soft” about “tabs”, not about “indentation”, so I understand it's okay to say baking tabs into the file as “hard tabs”. But wait...\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, what exactly we want to do is to *perform indentation*, not to *insert tabs or spaces* specifically. Tabs or spaces are just two naïve implementations of indentation. It sounds unnatural to me to use the words like “hard *tabs*” and “soft *tabs*” when talking about indentation. I don't know who has started such wording, but this is the time to reconsider what those words mean.\r\n\r\nInstead I propose this wording: “**soft indentation**” and “**hard indentation**”. Just like the “soft wrapping” leaves where to insert line break to the renderer, “soft indentation” leaves how much width a single level of indentation takes to the renderer.
